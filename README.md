# About Aura Browser
Aura is currently in active development. This repository is the rewritten version of the browser designed for iOS 26. For iOS 17 and 18 support, check out the [version 1.0 repo](https://github.com/doorhinge-apps/Aura-Browser). 

Despite being focused on iPadOS, Aura also supports iOS, macOS, and VisionOS. Full cross platform support is implemented in version 1.0 and will be coming to version 2.0 soon.
